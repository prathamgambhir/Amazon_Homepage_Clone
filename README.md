## Purpose

> This project was built to sharpen my **HTML and CSS skills**. It really helped me to understand how real-world websites like Amazon are structured and styled.

---

## Key Features

-  Fully structured layout similar to [Amazon.in](https://www.amazon.in)
-  Sticky navigation bar with:
  - Logo, search bar, language select, sign-in, cart etc
-  **Horizontally scrollable** product rows (bikes, gadgets, etc.)
-  Footer & Small Navbar with real working Amazon links 

---

## 🚧 Limitations

-  One **static hero/banner** image not changable
-  No mobile responsiveness (works only on desktop)
-  No JavaScript or interactivity
-  Internal links (product cards, categories) are static and non-clickable

---

##  Tech Stack

- **HTML** – For Structure of Website
- **CSS** – For styling
- **Font Awesome** – For icons (cart, flag etc.)
- 🔧 No frameworks or libraries used

## ⌛ Time Spent

 Built in just **1 day**  
 Horizontal scrolling sections were the most challenging but rewarding part!

---

##  What I Learned

- How to plan and build a webpage from scratch
- Flexbox layout and scrollable sections
- Real-world styling practices and debugging
- Using developer tools and external help (like GPT and docs)

---

##  Future Plans

-  Add **JavaScript** to create image sliders and interactive features
